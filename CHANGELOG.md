## 11.9.3
- Updated `agent` component from 11.9.2 to 11.9.10:
  - *Breaking changes*: moved `workflow.yaml` from `agent/agent/workflow.yaml` to `agent/workflow.yaml` (agent component root). NAT agents load this file on DRUM as well as DRAgent; see [workflow.yaml path migration](docs/agent/migration-workflow-yaml-path.md).
  - Allow running agent with `dragent` in Agentic Playground.
  - Upgraded `datarobot-genai` from 0.15.53 to 0.15.71
    - Fixed `extra_body` passthrough for workflow.yaml LLM configs

    - Improved user identity resolution in `dragent`
    - mem0 client User ID is now per-user
    - Registered `datarobot_moderation` NAT middleware; updated moderation config structure in `workflow.yaml`

    - Fixed `pulumi up` memory space when the user opts in.
    - Fixed issue with CrewAI streaming when model returns an empty chunk.
- [Experimental] Added optional DataRobot Memory Space persistence for chat history, OAuth identities, and user profiles in the FastAPI backend. Set `USE_MEMORY_SPACE=true` in `.env` and run `task deploy-dev` to provision a Memory Space via Pulumi and wire `USE_MEMORY_SPACE` / `MEMORY_SPACE_ID` on the custom application (not the agent deployment). Rerun `task deploy-dev` after changing `USE_MEMORY_SPACE` before `task dev`. Stores chats, messages, identities, and users as memory-service sessions and events instead of SQLite. Requires agentic memory API access on the organization (`ENABLE_AGENTIC_MEMORY_API`). See `docs/fastapi_server/README.md` and `.env.template`.

  - Added TTL to memory only if agent memory is enabled
  - Streaming chat completion wrapper now emits a dedicated chunk for the `RUN_FINISHED` AG-UI event before the final stop chunk; agents asserting on streaming chunk counts must expect one extra chunk.
- Upgraded MCP `datarobot-genai` from 0.15.2 to 0.15.32
  - Improved predictive drtools for MCP agents: rich tool_metadata descriptions, robust batch download polling and async-safe waits, safer CSV/JSON parsing for realtime predict, and more resilient deployment CSV validation (importance + whitespace/empty rows).
